Welcome!

**The Red Cell Theory** is a personal project born from a former researcher with a soft spot for telling stories about science, research, and biomedical discoveries in an narrative, and hopefully in an entertaining way. After years in the lab, I stepped into this incredible journey of storytelling and truly hope my project will catch your heart. Whether it’s through video essays, livestreams, discord discussions, or short articles, my goal is try to make science feel as **interesting, accessible, and engaging** in my own small way.

This space hosts development work for my digital platforms, community tools, behind-the-scenes bits of my content, and other eventual experimental projects (I remain a researcher at heart 🧪✨).

## 🧠 Who is behind all this?

Just me — a French scientist and epidemiologist, stepping out from the lab to share stories from the world of research and public health.
I'm exploring content creation and development as an enthusiastic hobbyist I pursue in my free time, alongside my professional career.

If my work here ignites a spark of curiosity in you, even for a fleeting moment, that truly makes my day !
