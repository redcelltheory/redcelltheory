## 🧬 What is this project?

Welcome!

**The Red Cell Theory** is a personal project born from a former researcher with a soft spot for telling stories about science, research, and biomedical discoveries in an narrative, and hopefully in an entertaining way. After years in the lab, I stepped into this incredible journey of storytelling and truly hope my project will catch your heart. Whether it’s through video essays, livestreams, discord discussions, or short articles, my goal is try to make science feel as **interesting, accessible, and engaging** in my own small way.

This GitHub space hosts development work for our digital platforms, community tools, behind-the-scenes bits of my content, and other eventual experimental projects (I remain a researcher at heart 🧪✨).

## 🧠 Who’s behind all this?

Just me — a French scientist and epidemiologist who is trying new things outside the laboratory.
I am not a professional content creator or developer and do this as a hobby on the side of my job.

If I can spark your curiosity, even just for a second, then I’m doing truly happy :)
