**Key Features (v0.1 & Beyond):**
* **Version 0.1:**
    * Page is live. The server is hosted locally.
    * Responsive two-panel _Coming Soon_ landing page.
    * Includes: Logo, project description, contact email, social media links, and a background banner.
* **What I'm Working On :**
    * Blog section for articles and science shorts.
    * Dedicated showcase for video essays and past livestreams.
    * Interactive community features.
    * 
* **Main Technologies (Stack):**
    * **Backend:** Python with the [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) framework.
    * **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript with [Bootstrap 5](https://getbootstrap.com/).
    * **Hosting (target):** To be determined (e.g., PythonAnywhere, Heroku, VPS)
    * **Database (target):** PostgreSQL / SQLite (for development)

* **Track Detailed Development:**

* **Key Objectives:**
    * ‚úÖ **Phase 1 (MVP - Minimum Viable Product):**
        * Basic site structure (home, articles, about, contact).
        * Simple article publishing system.
        * Responsive and modern design.
        * Initial deployment.
    * üéØ **Phase 2:**
        * Interactive features (comments, forum?).
        * Advanced multimedia content integration.
        * SEO optimization.
    * üéØ **Phase 3:**
        * Members' area?
        * Specialized sections (e.g., disease fact sheets, lab techniques).
* **Recent Milestones / Next Steps:**
    * Django development environment setup.
    * Creation of initial data models for articles.
    * Started Bootstrap template integration.
    * **Upcoming:** Development of views for displaying articles, creation of the administration system.

## 2. Discord Server & Scientific Community üí¨üî¨

* **Description:** Development of a Discord server for "The Red Cell Theory" to create an active and engaged community around biomedical science. The goal is to provide a space for discussion, resource sharing, scientific news, and mutual support. A key feature will be the integration of bots to automate scientific watch.
* **Current Status:** Planning / Initial Setup.
* **Key Planned Features:**
    * Thematic discussion channels (cell biology, genetics, immunology, news, etc.).
    * Voice channels for discussions and events.
    * Bot integration for:
        * **Automated scientific watch:**
            * Tracking RSS feeds from major scientific journals (Nature Medicine, Science, The Lancet, Cell, etc.).
            * Tracking epidemiological bulletins (WHO, ECDC, Public Health France, etc.).
            * **Advanced goal:** Automatic generation of summaries (abstracts) of newly published articles, ideally going beyond the limitations of MonitoRSS. Researching more robust solutions or developing a custom bot.
        * Roles and moderation.
        * Perhaps science quizzes or interactive events.
* **Recent Milestones / Next Steps:**
    * Creation of the basic Discord server structure (categories, initial channels).
    * Initial research and testing of bots for RSS feeds (e.g., MonitoRSS for a first version with Nature Med & Science).
    * **Upcoming:**
        * Definition of roles and permissions.
        * Exploration of alternative/complementary solutions to MonitoRSS for more numerous RSS feeds and summary generation (e.g., development of a Python bot, use of scientific news APIs if available, aggregation services).
        * Drafting a community charter.
* **Link to GitHub Project Board (if needed):** *(Optional, you can create a board for this project too if the need arises)*
* **Envisioned Tools:** Discord.py (for a custom bot), Zapier/IFTTT (for simple automations), API services for summaries (if found).
